<h3>My First JS app 🏄🏼‍♂️ 🏄🏼‍♂️ 🏄🏼‍♂️</h3>
<br />
<br />

My motivation?

To get introduced to Javascript syntax and logic 🔑
<br />
<br />

Why building a quiz?

The logic of quiz it not complicated, therefore, I was able to invent it myself rather than following an example 💎
<br />
<br />

What did I learn?

Main JS concepts, like functions, event handling, iteration using forEach(), etc 🤸🏻
